You have entered the website of Joel von Rotz. You might find something useful here, like my [notes](/notes) and my [photos](/photos).

In my free time I go biking, bouldering, camping and hiking. I've also recently started getting into [bikepacking](https://bikepacking.com/bikepacking-101/) & sewing.

## Now

Currently I'm doing my long civil service (6 months) at the sports school Engelberg *SSE*. After that and a 2 month cycling tour, I'll be doing my bachelor degree in electrical engineering at [HSLU Horw](https://www.hslu.ch/en/lucerne-school-of-engineering-architecture/).
