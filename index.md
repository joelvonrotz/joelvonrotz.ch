You have entered the website of Joel von Rotz. You might find something useful here, like my [notes](/notes) and my [photos](/photos).

In my free time I go biking, bouldering, camping and hiking. I've also recently started getting into [bikepacking](https://bikepacking.com/bikepacking-101/) & [sewing](/patterns).


I sometimes also [write](/posts) about stuff.
