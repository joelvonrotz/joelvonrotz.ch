# ðŸ“„ Documentation

As explained in the README, this is the space where all of the information is stored. I want to reveal it to you, so when you think about improving something on my JavaScript, HTML or CSS, you can easily see, what my thoughts during development was.

I hope it's useable ðŸ™„

## ðŸ”Ž Search

> Having a search page is neat. It allows the user to search for pages and posts in a easy-to-use way.

<div style="text-align:center">

![Filtering Posts](/.dev/concepts/search.drawio.svg)

</div>

### Goal

- Filter posts by terms
  - Filter it quick
- Don't block the process &rarr; when hundreds of posts exist, it would take too much time to filter through to still have a seamlessly experience &rarr; *maybe add at least a limit?*
