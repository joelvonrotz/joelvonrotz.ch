With this first post, I'll define this website as *unstable but somehow functional*. Just kidding!

## Rise & Shine (a little bit at least)

I've finally reached a state, where I'm happy with the design of the website. This website existed for almost an year now, not online but locally on my computer. I've kept redoing everything because I wasn't happy with how the websites looked like. Some were clunky, some straight up copied and some I don't even remember why I made them. I hope I can stay with this design, because I've put a lot more effort into it (a good example are some of the page-thumbnails).

> So far so good, right?

No, not really. A lot of things aren't yet implemented, like the [Projects](/projects)-page or the [Travelbook](/travelbook). With this iteration I wanted to start more organized, decide what my future post-writing workflow will be. Instead of simply throwing something together, I wanted build the site step by step. I don't know if I will document the progress of the site itself or not, only future will tell.
