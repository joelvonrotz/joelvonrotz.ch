Soon enough I'll be on my very first bikepacking trip with my brother and dad. It'll go through the Alsace region in France for 7-8 days. To be the best prepared boy in the world, I've decided to create a packing list, which I am going to share with you!

## Camping

For camping itself the main focus would be to lastly have a great sleep. That means packing enough but not too much stuff to feel snuggly inside your sleeping bag, bivy or quilt. There are different ways to camp, one of the most popular is of course with a [tent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tent), but there's also [hammock camping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammock_camping) and a [bivouac shelter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bivouac_shelter) (this one will not be listed here) 

### General

- [ ]  Sleeping Mat
- [ ]  Pyjamas → *separate clothes from your biking clothes to isolate the smell*

## Cooking

Who doesn't love cooking? Some people actually don't, but let's not consider them real people. Jokes aside, cooking is of course important, since your life depends on it. Goal of a good cooking equipment is too cover all your meals. That doesn't mean you get to take a fryer with you (you can, but  actually don't), as it still has to be lightweight.

- [ ]  Spices → *Salt, pepper, paprika, garlic, etc.*
- [ ]  Plate

## Repair

During a bikepacking trip, you're completely vulnerable to nature, which means your bike can get damaged! But since we're in *this* present, having to do little repairs and maintenance here & there is easy peasy. The amount of stuff you have to carry is dependent on how long your trip will be and how much damage could occur on the trip.

- [ ]  Multitool → *need at least following features*
  - Allen Key (check your screw sizes on your bike)
  - Screwdriver (flat & phillips)
- [ ]  Spare Inner Tubes → *depends on environment, more holes = more tubes*
- [ ]  Tube Repair Kit
  - Glue
  - Sandpaper → *to rough up the rubber so the glue holds better*
  - Tire Levers
  - Tube patches
- [ ]  Pump
- [ ]  Spare Spokes
- [ ]  Chain Brush
- [ ]  Chain Oil
- [ ]  Clean old Rags → *used to remove muck from the chain and bike parts*
- [ ]  Protective Tape
- [ ]  ELECTICAL TAPE → *Life Saver, tape together what needs to be taped together!!*

## Clothing

Clothing is important, so people don't see your private parts and no one  wants to see each others private parts, remember that. Also no one wants smell like a garbage can after wearing the same clothes for weeks. But throw the latter part out of the window, when you're bikepacking. Who needs noses anyway, am I right?

## On the Road

On the road you'll be doing loads of things: see landscape, say out loud a *Owen Wilson* "wow" and take a picture. Along all that you'll be checking where to go next, how much money you can spend that day and during boring rests you'll need something to do, like reading.
