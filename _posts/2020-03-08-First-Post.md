With this first post, I'll define this website as *unstable but somehow functional*. Just kidding!

<!--more-->

After reworking the website over and over, I've finally reached a starting point which I'm happy with. The site includes things like a non-functional [*Search*](/search) bar (I'll do something about this *soon*), an [*About*](/about) page and the blog itself. [*Projects*](/projects) & [*Photos*](/photos) have no function yet, but in the near future they will be implemented.
