## ðŸ—º What, where am I?

Hey, so you've stumbled upon my source code for my website. Besides the source code, you can also find a small documentation, which I wrote for myself during development (for example: how posts are filtered).

You can see the "documentation" in [.dev/documentation.md](/.dev/documentation.md)

## ðŸŽ¨ Website Theme

The theme of my website is heavily inspired by [0x0f0f0f's website](https://0x0f0f0f.github.io/). Colors have been chosen by me, what I took was the font, which is [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) (I love the font, because it looks smooth!)

If you like the theme, I might tune it a bit for customizability and show it off in a separate repository. For now it's just mine.
