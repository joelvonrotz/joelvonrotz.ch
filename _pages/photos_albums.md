[&larr; Back](/photos)

Here you can find story albums. Unlike the chaos that is the normal view (where you can see all photos), the album view focuses more on specific things, like insects or travels.

Also they currently only link to my flickr album view, as I haven't implemented the image viewer for the albums.
