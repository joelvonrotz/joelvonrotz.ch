I sometimes sew some stuff, like stem bags for the bike or small trail wallets (most of the patterns are based from the [Bikepacking.com](https://bikepacking.com) website).

For now I don't take any commissions/requests, as this is still a fresh hobby of mine. But once I'm feeling good enough to make these for other people, I might be open for stuff.
