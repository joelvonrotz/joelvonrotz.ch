Hey, the name is Joel and I'm preparing myself for the future. By preparing I just mean getting everything together.

I finished my apprenticeship as an electronics technician in 2019 and wanted to do something ever since. So I've taught myself a little bit of HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create this website. Besides some posts about small projects, I might also do talk about photography, electronics or traveling. At the end it depends how much I spend writing.

## About The Website

This website is run using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static website generator. The theme has been created by me and I'll probably release it to the public, once the desired features are implemented.
