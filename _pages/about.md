Hey, the name is Joel and I'm preparing myself for the future. By preparing I just mean getting everything together.

I finished my apprenticeship as an electronics technician in 2019 and wanted to do something ever since. So I've taught myself a little bit of HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create this website.
How much content here will be depends really on how much I actually write. I'm not really a good writer, but when I find something once in a while, I write about that thing.

## About The Website

This website is run using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static website generator.
